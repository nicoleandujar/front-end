<br>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<em>Yield: Serves 4</em>
<ul>
<li>4 Chicken Cultets</li>
<li>Kosher salt, to taste</li>
<li>Black pepper, to taste</li>
<li>1/4 cup Bobs Red Mill Arrowroot Starch</li>
<li>2-4 tbsp. olive oil</li>
<li>2 tbsp. ghee</li>
<li>2 shallots, diced</li>
<li>2 cloves garlic, sliced thinly</li>
<li>8oz. sliced mushrooms (baby bellas)</li>
<li>a pinch of crushed pepper flakes (optional)</li>
<li>3/4 cup to 1 cup of chicken broth</li>
<li>1 tbsp. balsamic vinegar</li>
<li>1/2 cup canned unsweet coconut milk, blended</li>
<li>juice of 1 lemon</li>



</ul>

<h3>Preparation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Place chicken cutlets on a cutting board. Cover with parchment paper and, using a meat mallet or a rolling pin, pound the chicken until its about 1/4 inch thin.</li>
<li>Discard the parchment paper. Cut the chicken cutlets down the center so that they are now two, thinly sliced separate pieces of chicken. You can keep them connected if you prefer, It won't make a difference.</li>
<li>Season the chicken on both sides with kosher salt and black pepper, to taste.</li>
<li>Place 1/4 cup arrowroot on a plate or wide bowl. Dredge the chicken cutlets so that they are just lightly coated on all sides. You don't have to use all of the arrowroot - you just want the chicken lightly coated. Set aside on a plate.</li>
<li>eat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add 2 tbsp. olive oil and swirl the pan so the bottom is coated in the oil.</li>
<li>Sear the chicken (you may need to do this in batches depending on the size of your skillet), until lightly golden brown on both sides, about 3-4 minutes a side. After both sides are browned remove from skillet and set aside on a plate. (it doesn't necessarily have to be completely cooked through yet, it will continue to cook in the sauce later). If you are working in batches, you will likely need to add more olive oil in between to ensure the skillet isn't too dry.</li>
<li>When all of your chicken is browned, reduce heat to medium. Add ghee and let melt, then add the shallots, garlic, and sliced mushrooms. Season with salt and pepper, and crushed red pepper flakes (if using). Saute until mushrooms are tender, about 5 minutes.</li>
<li>Add the chicken broth, coconut milk, vinegar, and the juice of the lemon. Stir to combine and the reduce heat so that the sauce is just simmering.</li>
<li>Nestle the chicken back into the sauce and let simmer for 8-10 minutes, or until the sauce thickens and the chicken is completely cooked through. If your sauce is too thick, add 1/4 cup of chicken broth more to thin it out to desired consistency.</li>
<li>Top with parsley and serve! Serve with zucchini noodles to keep it whole30 approved, or try serving with brown rice gluten free pasta for a healthier pasta dish.</li>
</ul>
