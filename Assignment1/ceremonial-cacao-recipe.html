<pre><em>This recipe is specifically for ceremony, so it will be a larger dose of cacao.
The cacao should be whole cacao paste, not defatted powder that is sold commercially
It should be 100% cacao, not alkalized or Dutch processed. Those processes are commonly
used for chocolate bars and candies and they make the cacao not suitable for Cacao ceremony.</em></pre>

<br>
<h2> Assemble the Ingredients</h2>
<em> Yields: This recipe is to be measured for each person who consumes cacao.</em>
<ul>
<li>7 fluid ounces of water per person</li>
<li>2 oz (6 tablespoons) cacao per person. If you are using a scale, you can weigh 2 oz per person. If you are not using a scale, 2 oz of cacao is about 6 tablespoons of chopped cacao</li>
<li>Pinch of chilli/cayenne</li>
<li>Natural sweetener of your choice such as honey, agave syrup, cane sugar, etc. to taste. <br><em>(This is optional.
  It is not necessary to sweeten the cacao drink to benefit from the cacao in ceremony. But most people will find the drink more enjoyable this way)</em></li>
<li>Other options are to: add cinnamon, cardamom, and/or vanilla to taste</li>
</ul>

<br>
<h3>Preparation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Start with the cacao bar and chop with a knife into smaller pieces so it softens easily in hot water</li>
<li>Heat water with chili to just before a boil. It should be just too hot to the touch but not boiling</li>
<li>Add the cacao shavings</li>
<li>Add sweetening and spices to taste</li>
<li>Use a whisk to stir the brew until it is all the chunks are blended and you get a frothy top</li>
</ul>

<br>
<pre>It is helpful to have a spoon or stirring stick to keep the consistency even as you consume.
The cacao will settle at the bottom over time. Serve hot & enjoy!</pre>
<p><strong>We recommend the chilli/cayenne spice as it helps potentiate the cacao but it is possible to have a successful ceremony without it.</strong>
