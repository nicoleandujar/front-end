<p>This is specifically for ceremony, so it will be a larger dose of cacao.<br>
The cacao should be whole cacao, not defatted powder that is sold commercially.<br>
It should be 100% cacao, not alkalized or Dutch processed. Those processes are commonly<br>
used for chocolate bars and candies and they make the cacao not suitable for Cacao ceremony.</p>


<h2> Assemble the Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
<li>7 fluid ounces of water per person</li>
<li>2 oz (6 tablespoons) cacao per person. If you are using a scale, you can weigh 2 oz per person. If you aren’t using a scale, 2 oz of cacao is about 6 tablespoons of chopped cacao</li>
<li>Pinch of chilli/cayenne</li>
<li>Natural sweetener of your choice such as honey, agave syrup, cane sugar, etc. to taste. This is optional.
  It is not necessary to sweeten the cacao drink to benefit from the cacao in ceremony. But most people will find the drink more enjoyable this way</li>
<li>Other options are to: add cinnamon, cardamom, and/or vanilla to taste</li>
</ul>

<h3>Preparation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Start with the cacao bar and chop with a knife into smaller pieces so it softens easily in hot water</li>
<li>Heat water with chili to just before a boil. It should be just too hot to the touch but not boiling</li>
<li>Add the cacao shavings</li>
<li>Add sweetening and spices to taste</li>
<li>Use a whisk to stir the brew until it's all the chunks are blended and you get a frothy top</li>
</ul>

It is helpful to have a spoon or stirring stick to keep the consistency even as you consume. <br>
The cacao will settle at the bottom over time.<br>
Serve hot & enjoy!
